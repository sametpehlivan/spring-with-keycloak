Jwt - Method Level Authorization uses JwtAuthenticationConverter by default.
And in this Converter Token, it searches for the "scope" field or the "scp" field.
{
    ...
    ...
    ...
    //keycloak uses this
    "scope": "profile email", -> Converts to Granted Authority List in Spring -> ["SCOPE_profile","SCOPE_email"]
        or
    "scope": ["profile","email"], -> the same goes
        or
    "scp": "profile email", -> the same goes
        or
    "scp": ["profile","email"] , -> the same goes
    ...
    ...
    ...

}

Adds "SCOPE_" to the beginning of each value separated by array or white space.
And these authorities(scopes,roles) are added to JwtAuthenticationToken.
